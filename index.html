			<h2>My passions</h2>
			<p>
				I am a FAN of travelling. So far I have visited ten different countries going from a small island where it feels like time stopped called Rodrigues to the city where everything seems possible, New York and I want to discover more and more.
				I am also passionated about music. Since my youngest age I've singing my lungs out and since not so long ago I decided to start to learn the guitare to have a nice background melody when I sing.

			<h2>My Activities</h2>
			<p>
				I haven't always been a sports addict but I started practicing kick boxing for two years and I love it.
				I am also a member of the HeForShe club at ESSEC which the feminist club of the school as I've been one since I was born. I am at the campus pole which mean that I need to organise events for the club to spread more informations about feminism around the school and make people know better about what it is.
